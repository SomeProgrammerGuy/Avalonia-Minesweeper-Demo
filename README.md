# Avalonia-Minesweeper-Demo
A demonstration cross platform NET Core Minesweeper clone using the Avalonia UI. 

This is only currently 98% working and is really just something I quickly put together to get a feel of how Avalonia works.

This is not the best platform for writing any game. If writing a game is your aim there are much better cross platform choices.
